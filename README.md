# STMS
Strait Traffic Monitoring Simulation (STMS) is a sample federation application for High Level Architecture, which serves as a running-example for the book "Guide to Distributed Simulation Using HLA" (see https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-61267-6).

## Scenario
A traffic monitoring station tracks the ships passing through the strait. Any ship entering the strait announces her name and then periodically reports her position to the station and to the other ships in the strait using the radio channels.
